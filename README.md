# Reference Style
There are two items that often need to be considered regarding the reference format for journal papers:
  1. Abbreviations of journal name.
  2. Reference format.

This repository is applicable to use in EndNote (applicable on EndNote 20 and 21).

This repository refers to journal names in engineering, specifically in civil and construction engineering.
The reference style refers to its use in the Journal of Building Engineering with numeric format.

## Abbreviation of Journal Name (Science and Engineering)
To apply abbreviation to references in a journal paper:
 1. Please go to Library -> Open Term Lists -> Journal Term List.
 2. On the 'Terms' tab, remove the existing journals list: select all and delete.
 3. Add new journal list: Go to 'Lists' tab, select 'Journals', and Import List'.
 4. It has several journal lists existing on EndNote. For my case, it's required to download the Science and Engineering Journal Abbreviations_20231013.txt file (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdkiAfb4BDg8_MJ6JryDMeH4povhpq2_/view or on the folder of 'abbreviation' in this repository).
 5. Then, you have a new journal list and the abbreviation.
